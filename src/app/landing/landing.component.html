    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of the ICAN system is to give a leadership team of an
      organization a method of communicating and organizing itself with or
      without the use of the electric grid and cellular network. The ICAN system
      can send out forms to its members to collect information during an
      emergency, which will be collected by the ICAN system and used to populate
      various reports. Allowing leadership to organize and direct a response as
      quickly as possible.

      During emergencies when electric power and cellular towers are still
      functioning, the ICAN system will utilize standard texting services to
      contact all members of the organization. When the electric grid and
      cellular networks are down, the ICAN system will utilize a mesh network of
      private single user antennas made by GoTenna. These miniature antennas
      connect with the userâ€™s cell phone via Bluetooth and allows users to text
      each other, within a 5 to 8 mile radius, without being connected to a
      cellular network.
